# Parametric-Case-Enclosure
Parametric Case-Enclosure in FreeCad for electronics or other projects.

Status: seems to be working, not high priority for me right now, but still on my mind.

Features:

        Rather than print the top and bottom, you can just use sheet
        stock to keep the printing to a minimum, or you can print the top and bottom.
        
        Height width and depth are entered in a spreadsheet, all parts then change
        
        May be assembled with m3 hardware, self threading bolts, or other hardware.
        
        Punch outs in front, rear, right side, left side, top and bottom are controlled by front and rear sketches that are
        easily customized.
        
        You can add drill holes in top, bottom, front and back or skip them depending on whether you need them or
        not, this depends a lot on how you choose to print the enclosure.
        
        There are a variety of ways to print the case, you decide which parts to fuse ( union )
        and then print them.  If you use sheet stock top and bottom then the rest can be printed assembled
        one part.
